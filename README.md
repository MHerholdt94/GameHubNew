A project where I created a fictional website where users can buy and sell video games and read gaming news.

## Description

This website is made as a Cross-Course Project at NOROFF, spanning multiple courses such as design, HTML & CSS, programming foundations and interaction design. The website has been through several iterations before getting to the current version. It started as a simple site with, in my opinion, under par design choices, no JavaScript and rather weak responsiveness etc. 

Over time after attending the courses mentioned the site has grown in quality overall, and might continue to grow in the future.

A few points I focused on:

- Simple design and layout that is easy to navigate
- Store page with a shopping cart with dynamic price change depending on added products
- Products added in WordPress database and fetched through REST API

## Built With

The website is built using

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/)
